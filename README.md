# Production Deployment Patterns (AI Generated)

## Overview
This project demonstrates AI-assisted generation of production deployment artifacts.

## Generated Artifacts
- main.tf: Terraform infrastructure module
- argocd-app.yaml: ArgoCD GitOps application manifest
- COST_NOTES.txt: Cost optimization analysis

## What This Does
- Generates Infrastructure as Code
- Generates GitOps deployment configuration
- Provides cost awareness early in design

## What This Does NOT Do
- Does NOT apply Terraform
- Does NOT deploy to Kubernetes
- Does NOT create real cloud resources

## Why This Matters
In real-world DevOps, templates and generators speed up
delivery while keeping human review in control.
