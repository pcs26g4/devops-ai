It then attempted to **retry the connection**. Subsequently, the **service was successfully restarted**.\n\n**Main Issue:**\nThe main issue is a **database connection timeout**. This indicates the service is unable to establish or maintain a connection with its database, which often prevents it from functioning correctly until the connection is restored or the service is restarted. The `WARN` and `INFO` messages are reactions/mitigations to this underlying problem."
